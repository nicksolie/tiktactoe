### Development

## Future Iterations

Areas I see room for improvement:

*Features*
- The inclusion of a computer opponent so users with no nearby partner can enjoy the game.
- Hide the input fields until users click on a button. This will help reduce the clutter and make a more friendly appearance.
- When clicking on game stats, users should get more information related to their account, such as total won games.
- A share button to forward the game and the user’s results to other people.

*Styling*
- Prior to signing in, I’d like for users to be shown a gif on how the game is played.
- A rework of the color scheme and the introduction of styled X’s and O’s. The use of SVGs as a replacement for standard X’s and O’s would bring more life to the board.
- A new typography.
- Styled buttons.
- The inclusion of an instructions pages that details how the page works and what the rules of the game are.

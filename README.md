### Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe Game!

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game where players compete to strike a line of three X's or O's on a 3x3 grid. Below is my first project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.

### Development

Since this is the first web development application I’ve built, my development process after an initial planning phase was effectively ad-hoc. I started by creating the game board itself so I could have a representation of the primary function of the application. I then used the game board layout to guide me through the user storied I created during planning.

A lesson I’ve learned from this project is to notice when unsuccessful problem solving turns into unsuccessful time management.

## User Stories and Wireframe

*My user stories from initial planning:*
- As an unregistered player, I want to sign up so the app can track my score across games.
- As a registered player, I want to sign in so my score can be track across multiple games.
- As a signed in user, I want to be able to change my password.
- As a signed in user, I want to be able to log out.
- As a signed in user, I want to be able to start a new tic tac toe.
- As a signed in user who started a game, I want to place a permanent X to start.
- As a signed in user who started a game, I want to rotate between X and O turns.
- As a signed in user who started a game, I want to only place X or O on open spaces
- As the board, I want to stay blank or flip X/O so that the user can complete a turn.
- As a player, I want to connect three marks in a row so I can win the game or tie.
- As a signed in user who finished a game, I do not want to be able to keep playing on that board.
-As a player, I want the game to reset so I can play multiple games.
-As a player, I want to be able to see how many games ive played.

## Future Iterations

*Areas I see room for improvement:*

*Features*
- The inclusion of a computer opponent so users with no nearby partner can enjoy the game.
- Hide the input fields until users click on a button. This will help reduce the clutter and make a more friendly appearance.
- When clicking on game stats, users should get more information related to their account, such as total won games.
- A share button to forward the game and the user’s results to other people.

*Styling*
- Prior to signing in, I’d like for users to be shown a gif on how the game is played.
- A rework of the color scheme and the introduction of styled X’s and O’s. The use of SVGs as a replacement for standard X’s and O’s would bring more life to the board.
- A new typography.
- Styled buttons.
- The inclusion of an instructions pages that details how the page works and what the rules of the game are.
